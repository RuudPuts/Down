 Boxcar is a singleton that encapsulate interface to Boxcar Push Platform.
 
 @copyright ProcessOne © 2012-2017
 
 The framework integrates two types of push notifications:
 1. Full support for *Apple Push Notification Service* (APNS).
 2. *InApp push*, which is a a push system that does not get through Apple Push. Its main advantage is that it does not requires the user to approve the reception of push messages through Apple mechanism. As such it can be fully used as a way to keep a realtime communication channel between Boxcar server and the application itself. The drawback is that it will only work while the application is running. This means that you also need to implement APNS as well if you want to notify the user after the 10 minutes the application is allowed to run in background.

 Using this class should be enough to fully control Push Service from your application.

 Associate a unique ID to device if advertising tracking is authorized by user.
 
 If your backend application requires being able to send push notification using a unique device id, you can use this method to associate that device to a unique device ID.

 The device ID can use any value. Possible values are:
 - VendorId: You can use Apple Vendor ID to get the same identifier for all your applications on the same device:

   ~~~{.m}

      [[Boxcar sharedInstance] setIdentifier:vendorID];

   ~~~
 
 - AdvertisingIdentifier: If your application is displaying advertising (only in that case) and if your application is linked against AdSupport.framework, you can use Advertising identifier as unique ID:
 
   ~~~{.m}
      // All those calls require your app to be linked with AdSupport.framework
      NSString *advertiserID = [[[ASIdentifierManager sharedManager] advertisingIdentifier] UUIDString];
      [[Boxcar sharedInstance] setIdentifier:advertiserID];

 This is not a permanent failure, so registration will be retried. It means you can receive more than one notification for a registration call (possibly several failures before one success).
 
 Note: Those notification are NSNotification instance. This is internal code state change events. They have nothing to do with push notifications.
 
 The userinfo dictionary from the NSNotification object typically contains two keys @"code" and @"message" which give extra information on the notification status. For failure, it
 gives an idea of the reason of the failure to process the call.
